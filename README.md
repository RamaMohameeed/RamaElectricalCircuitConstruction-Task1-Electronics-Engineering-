###  Electronics Engineering Project | constructed & Documented by a Software Engineer

This project focuses on building a simple **LED control circuit using Arduino UNO R3 and three push buttons** , where each button turns on its corresponding LED when pressed.

As a **Software Engineer**, I **constructed and documented** this project using the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**, which helps ensure **quality and efficiency throughout all project phases by reducing risks, improving communication, and delivering solutions that meet user needs on time**.

>  Applied SDLC:  
> **Planning → Requirements Analysis → Design → Coding → Testing**

##  Project Summary

The goal was to build a real-time interactive circuit using Arduino UNO R3, where three push buttons control **three LEDs — Red, Yellow, and Blue** — turning each LED ON when its corresponding button is pressed and OFF when released, all simulated and tested using **Tinkercad**.

By following the SDLC, the **Electrical Circuit Construction** was completed successfully with structured development and accurate results.
